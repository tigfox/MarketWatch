Raspberry Pi E-Ink Stock Ticker

Uses a PapiRus E-Ink display: https://www.adafruit.com/product/3335
On a Raspberry Pi Zero W: https://www.adafruit.com/product/3708
You'll need the PaPiRus libraries: https://github.com/PiSupply/PaPiRus
And either an AlphaVantage account: https://www.alphavantage.co/support/#api-key
Or (recommended) the yfinance python library: https://github.com/ranaroussi/yfinance

Depending which you use, you can run the script on a cron to update the display.
That's it.
